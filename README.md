The profile name appears as an item on the left-hand side of the status bar.

You can change the profile by clicking the item.

## Activation

The extension is loaded after VS Code has fully loaded. It is non-blocking, so does not affect startup times.

To be more specific, the [activation event](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) is `onStartupFinished`.

## Settings

## FAQ

### Why isn't it appearing in the Status Bar?

Perhaps, this extension is not included in your current profile. Run the command **`Profiles: Show contents...`** to check.

The item may have been forced out (not enough room), or hidden! Right-clicking on the status bar shows a complete list of status bar items, and if they are enabled or not.

### Does this extension support multi-root workspaces?

No! I do not use them!

If you would like support added, raise an issue to request the feature. A contibution is welcome.

### Does this support remote or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)?

The extensions looks on the local file system for the global state in a file called *storage.json*. This may not be available when you are working remotely, or in WSL.

If you have a suggestion to add support - a contibution is welcome.
