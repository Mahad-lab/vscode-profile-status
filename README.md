The profile name appears as an item on the left-hand side of the status bar.

You can change the profile by clicking the item.

## Activation

The extension is loaded after VS Code has fully loaded. It is non-blocking, so does not affect startup times. 

To be more specific, the [activation event](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) is `onStartupFinished`.

## FAQ

### Why isn't it appearing in the Status Bar?

Perhaps, this extension is not included in your current profile. Run the command **`Profiles: Show contents...`** to check.

Is your status bar crowded? The item may have been forced out! You can test this by zooming out, so the text becomes very small, and you will see more items on the status bar. You can hide or disable other status bar items to make space.
